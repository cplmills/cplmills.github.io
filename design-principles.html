                    <h1>Visual Heirarchy</h1>
                    <h2>Simply Chocolate</h2>

                    <div>Visual Heirarchy - The idea that there is an order to the way the human eye interacts with a page. Visual Heirarchy can involve colours, shapes, patters to drawer the eye to parts of a UX in a particular way. I think that Simply Chololate does this well. When you visit the site on a mobile browser, your eye is immediately drawn to a choloate bar in teh middle of the page, from here you notice the movement of the pieces of Chocolate at teh bottom of the page which then drawers your eyes upwards to the description and link to the store.</div>

                    <h1>Fitts Law</h1>
                    <h2>Hubspot</h2>
                    <a href="https://www.hubspot.com" target="_blank">https://www.hubspot.com</a>
                    <div>Fitts Law - <I>"The time required to move to a target area is a function of the distance to the target and the size of the target".</I> I liked the examaple that I found on Hubspot simply because the aim of the site is obviously to get you to sign up and try Hubspot and the "Start free or get a demo" button has pride of place in the design flow and is large enough to be the focal point of your eye once the page loads.</div>

                    <div>Repetition - Repetition can come in many styles. It acan be a repetative use of colours, fonts, page layouts, layout elements. Repetition creates a sense of belonging. I chose The Lit Pub because they make good use of a repetative design flow. It is hard to see from the image above but each book has its own section that repeats all the way down the page. It make navigation very easy and predictable.</div>
