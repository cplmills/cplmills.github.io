                <p>Scoots is possibly the best motor scooter rental company located on the island of Cozumel off the coast of Mexico in the western Caribbean Sea. We are an owner-operator company that caters to locals, walk-in tourists, enthusiasts, and cruise-based touring groups and partnerships. Our company has two physical rental locations on Cozumel. One is near the Playa del Carmen-Cozumel Ferry dock in el Centro de Cozumel and the other is near the Terminal Puerta Maya further south along the coast which caters to the cruise lines and patrons. We promote friendly and easy to rent services of motor scooters, jeeps, and side-by-sides ATVs. </p>
