                <h2>A Brief History of the Island</h2>
                <p>Cozumel was a commercial and ceremonial centre during the Mayan period (about 250 to 950 CE), and the island has several small archaeological sites. In 1518 Juan de Grijalva led the first Spanish expedition to Cozumel. In 1519 Hernán Cortés used the island as a base for Spanish efforts to conquer the Maya. During most of the Spanish colonial era, Cozumel was only sparsely populated, but trading ships and pirates occasionally sought shelter and replenished supplies on the island, which was protected behind offshore reefs. Area 189 square miles (489 square km). Pop. (2005) 71,401; (2010) 77,236.<i>Information courtesy of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Cozumel">https://www.britannica.com/place/Cozumel</a></i></p>

                <h2>Tour 1 - Cozumel Ruins</h2>
                <img src="images/ruins.webp" alt="Mysterious Cozumel Ruins">
                <p>Built in the late 1300's, these ruins are from an unknown group of settlers who inhabited the island looking for shelter from the many pirates who wreaked havoc 
                    in the Caribbean during the time. Legend says that they buries their treasure somewhere in the grounds of these ruins and that one day, an ancient ritual
                    will be completed at the grounds which will reveal the site of the treasure. Some claim the treasure is simply pirate gold. Others claim that it is the chalice thought to have been the Holy Grail.
                    Come and check out the site and see if you can find any clues to its secret past!

                <h2>Tour 3 - Famous El Puerto Diablo Beach</h2>
                <img src="images/devilbeach.webp" alt="El Puerto Diablo Beach - Devil Chicken Beach">
                <p>Yes you read it right "Devil Chicken Beach" once feared for the fearsome breed of chicken which roamed its sands, attacking tourists and locals alike. The chickens have long since gone, eaten by pirates and 
                    cooked into chilli, the only remnants of these little devils are said to be strange scratching sounds that can be heard in the scrub at night.
                    What remains at Devil Chicken Beach is its pure white sand. Said to be some of the purest sand found on earth, this sand is a fantastic natural exfoliant
                    and has remarkable properties for healing the skin and cleaning your jewellery. The beach is also home to Uncle Bob's Dive Company, learn to scuba dive on the 
                    pristine reefs and swim under the waters looking for lost pirate treasure. Your kids can even go snorkeling in the shallows and play with the local fish and sealife who are 
                    very tame and friendly to visitors.
